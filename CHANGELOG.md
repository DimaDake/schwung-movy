# Changelog

All notable changes to Movy are documented here. The format is loosely based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

Movy is an early prototype and was developed rapidly without tagged releases, so
`0.21.0` is the **first documented release** — it bundles everything built so
far. Earlier work is summarised in the timeline below for context.

> **Note on versions:** the app/tool version (`module.json`) and the Rust
> sequencer engine's `ENGINE_VERSION` are tracked separately. Versions below
> refer to the app unless noted.

## [Unreleased]

- _Nothing yet._

## [0.23.0] — 2026-07-21

A large release focused on **synchronising Movy with Move's transport**, a new
**per-track LFO page**, **parameter visualisations** (envelopes, filters, LFO
waveforms), **per-voice drum editing**, and a fleet-wide pass over module
layouts. Engine bumped `0.22.0` → `0.26.0`.

### Added — one transport with Move
- **Automatic clock follow** — Movy's playhead locks to Move's transport
  (drift-free), captures its tempo, and shows an **EXT** indicator while
  following. The TEMPO knob writes tempo back to the device.
- **Background mode** — Back at the root view opens a **Leave** menu; choosing
  Background parks Movy under Move's own screens while the sequencer keeps
  running (render/LED work is skipped while parked; `onResume()` forces a full
  repaint on return). **Shift + Back** exits instantly.
- **LINK toggle** (Set page, knob 4) — opt in to a shared transport: Play/Stop
  on either Movy or Move starts and stops both. Gated behind a per-set
  `link_enabled` flag and persisted with the set.
- **MIDI transport emission** — the engine emits Start / 24 ppqn Clock / Stop
  while playing; synced LFOs phase-lock to the transport instead of free-running.

### Added — per-track LFO page
- A fifth chain slot exposing the track's **two Schwung slot LFOs** with a live
  **waveform display** (shape, rate/sync, depth, phase, retrigger dot; skew
  deformation and shapes 6–10).
- **Hold any knob (1 s)** to assign it as an LFO modulation target; modulated
  params are marked with a `~` and keep their base value underneath.

### Added — parameter visualisations
- **Envelope graphics** now cover **partial** envelopes — AD / AR / ASR / ADS
  render as 2- or 3-stage shapes, not just full ADSR.
- **Filter-response curves** — detect a cutoff+resonance pair, reorder them onto
  one line, and draw a mode-aware curve (LP/HP/BP/open) with a rounded corner
  and steep roll-off.
- **Module-LFO waveforms** on any module — shape detection by name inference,
  with rate (1–2 cycles) and depth encoded under the graphic.
- Visualisations track the **automation value** currently being edited.

### Added — per-voice drum editing
- **Forge** — 16-pad Kit A/B layout with full **per-voice editing**
  (playback-safe `pv<N>_` writes), a curated per-voice **automation** set
  (Kit A), and a per-voice **Send** page (reverb/delay/pan). Driven by a
  self-describing `movy_config.json` shipped with the module.
- **libpo32** — consumes the module's self-describing per-voice layout
  (`v<N>_` direct keys, dynamic `chain_params`).

### Changed — module layouts (fleet-wide dump pass)
- **Module metadata now wins over config** — `movy_config.json` only fills gaps
  the module's own hierarchy leaves.
- Curated layouts for chordism, sfz, 303, chiptune, hush1 (+ mrdrums choke);
  param pages for `chain_params`-only modules; one-page-per-bank alignment and
  named preset knobs.
- **Knob sensitivity normalised** to a consistent per-range sweep.
- Corrected param ranges to match DSP clamps (weird-dreams, essaim; mrdrums
  vol/attack/polyphony expanded to native range).
- On-screen short-name dedup overhaul; int type/range inferred for
  metadata-less params; preset knobs no longer render on two pages.

### Added — tooling
- **Module inventory dump** — a device collector plus a Movy layout snapshot,
  and a **dump-replay regression suite** over all 76 fleet modules wired into
  `npm test`.

## [0.22.0] — 2026-07-01

### Added
- **Per-set state** — the sequencer and UI state (root note + scale) are now
  stored per Ableton Move *set*, keyed by the active set's UUID (read from
  `active_set.txt`). Switching sets recalls an independent Movy project,
  aligned with how Schwung stores its tracks per set. Duplicating a set in Move
  (Copy/Paste) inherits the parent set's Movy state.

### Changed
- Movy no longer keeps a single global sequencer state. **Breaking:** the old
  global `seq-state.json` is abandoned and not migrated; each set starts from
  its own per-set state (blank unless inherited from a copied parent).

## [0.21.0] — 2026-06-30

First documented release. Highlights of everything built to date:

### Added — parameter UI
- Automatic parameter pages for any Schwung module (reads the module's hierarchy).
- Arc knobs, enum knobs, and a full-screen scrollable **enum overlay**.
- **ADSR envelope graphics** — A/D/S/R groups auto-detected and drawn as one
  envelope shape instead of four knobs.
- Multi-page modules; full chain navigation (MIDI FX → Synth → FX 1 → FX 2) and a
  master FX chain in Session view.
- Module browser to load/swap modules per slot.

### Added — sequencer (4 Schwung tracks, aligned with Move)
- Rust sequencer engine (`seq-core` + `dsp.so`) with transport, clips, recording,
  sessions, and persistence.
- Clip step entry/editing, Session view & clip launching, live recording with
  count-in and metronome, loop/bar editing, duplicate/delete, quantize, mute.
- **Parameter automation** — record knob moves live or per-step; values latch to
  their end trigger; on-screen knob arc follows automation; per-lane clearing.

### Added — beyond Move
- **Step parameters** — per-trig velocity, length, probability, A:B condition,
  invert (Elektron-style parameter locks).
- **Clip parameters** — scale, length, transpose (Shift + Step 3).
- **Set parameters** — tempo, swing, root, key (Shift + Step 5 / 7 / 9).

### Added — keyboard & drums
- Two-octave chromatic keyboard per track with octave shifting.
- Drum modules switch the pads to a 4×4 rack with per-voice parameter pages;
  layout templates for Mr Drums and Weird Dreams.

### Added — docs & project
- README, MANUAL, CONTRIBUTING, MIT LICENSE, and UI screenshots.

### Known limitations
- No undo, no capture, chromatic keyboard only (no scale-aware pad layouts),
  four Schwung tracks only, simplified clip model. See the
  [manual](MANUAL.md#7-limitations-vs-move).
