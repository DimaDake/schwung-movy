# Generator bench: flash35-new

Level BALANCED, 42 cases, 1 run(s) each. Missing sources: gigamidi (gated).

**Alignment** (headline) = best option's recovery of the clean part (messy quantize) or alignment with the real B (variation), 0-1. **Gate** = all three options usable and pairwise different. Fit/groove are diagnostics. Idea kept per option 1 / 2 / 3. Latency excludes cached replies.
